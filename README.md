# FinalProject

This repository contains the code and poster for our final project. 

The repository is divided into several directories: 
- ``Dataset`` contains python code for custom dataset classes and a .ipynb file for data collection on Colab. 
- ``Main`` contains python code for initializing models and training them. 
- ``Model`` contains python code for our three models and helper functions. 
- ``Results`` contains .ipynb file for visualizing loss and sample results.

We also included Final Poster and shell script in the root directory.
